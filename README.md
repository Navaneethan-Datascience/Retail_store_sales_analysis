Date Functions: YEAR(), MONTH(), DATE_FORMAT(), STR_TO_DATE()
Conditional Logic: CASE WHEN statements for data categorization
Joins: CROSS JOIN for percentage calculations
Partitioning: PARTITION BY for grouped window operations
Data Quality: Handling NULL values, negative quantities, and edge cases

📈 Key Findings

> Revenue Insights
1. 90.15% of revenue comes from the United Kingdom
2. 68% MoM decline from December 2010 to January 2011
3. 37 countries represent untapped growth opportunities

> Product Insights
1. Top 0.53% of products drive majority of sales
2. 25.63% of products are slow-movers
3. Product 22423 alone generates 3.06% of total revenue
4. 0.04% product return rate with Product 22617 being highest

> Customer Insights
1. Average revenue per customer: £1,034.32 (high-value customers)
2. 961 out of 1,054 customers (91%) are UK-based
3. Significant customer concentration risk

🚀 Business Recommendations
Immediate Actions:
Investigate Revenue Decline: Determine if 68% drop is seasonal or structural
Optimize Product Portfolio: Discontinue slow-movers, focus on proven performers
Quality Control: Address high returns for specific products (e.g., 22617)

Strategic Priorities:
1. Geographic Diversification: Reduce 90% UK dependency through international expansionInventory
2. Management: Implement data-driven forecasting to reduce dead stock
3. Customer Segmentation: Leverage high AOV (£1,034) with targeted retention programs
